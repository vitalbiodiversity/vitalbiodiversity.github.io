# THE PROBLEM

What does it mean to innovate when creating technologies for ecological purposes? Certainly not by merely generating more ecosystem data, or releasing yet another AI tool to identify species faster. Hundreds of tools like that are currently produced, and few of these meaningfully connect our growing ecosystem awareness to the intricate level of decision-making needed to protect, restore, or adapt to ecosystems. They turn barely living ecosystems into disconnected data fragments further stripped of their vitality. 

<br>
<span style="color:#00ADEE;">Ecosystems are not computers. They are alive. What if data systems reflected that vitality?
</span> 
<br>
<br>

Pursuing real innovation demands more creative proposals. Avant-garde ideas that are less technology-driven and much more fundamentally engaged with the living planet. It is only in this way that important new ecosystem data can be used to respond to ecological crises.

The main vision of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF), signed by 196 countries, is <span style="color:#71BE44;">'a world of living in harmony with nature'</span> by 2050. This calls for technologies that do not just deliver ecosystem data but also embed this global vision into their design. This brief calls for designers, developers, and other future-makers to propose biodiversity data systems that are as <span style="color:#71BE44;">alive</span> as the ecosystems they are connected to.

<br>

# DESIGN OBJECTIVE

Design a data tool or platform that is alive, and grounded in the following three principles:


<br>

It must be <span style="color:#FAAE17;">response-able</span> (capable of engaging with its context rather than merely representing it), <span style="color:#FAAE17;">organic</span> (inspired by ecosystem processes rather than technical features), and <span style="color:#FAAE17;">relational</span> (structured around interdependence rather than data fragmentation). 
 
The design may focus on environmental processes at any scale deemed relevant in response to ecological crises – from the lived experiences of individual organisms within an ecosystem to the broader dynamics of planetary systems. Your goal is to spark technological innovation rooted in ecological vitality.

<br>
<br>

# KEY STAKEHOLDERS
- <span style="color:#71BE44;">Living ecosystems</span>, humans, and multi-species entities whose expressions and lives are turned into data.

<br>
  
- <span style="color:#71BE44;">Corporations</span> committed to move beyond impact metrics towards aligning their operations with ecological regeneration and the KMGBF vision.
<br>
  
- <span style="color:#71BE44;">Specialists</span> who collect and work with data including monitoring experts, citizen scientists, ecologists, local communities, and other ecosystem data users.

<br>
<br>

# DESIGN CRITERIA

<br>
## 1. Center vital aesthetics

Data tools must abandon their fixation on computational expressions and attend to the full range of aesthetics that ecosystems evoke. Aesthetics encompass everything that creates meaning for living beings. including sensory perceptions, affective dimensions, hierarchies, and cultural relations. This shapes all experiential aspects of innovation.
 
To revolutionize design in this domain, designers must identify important qualities of <span style="color:#00ADEE;">aliveness</span> and relations to broader ecosystem experiences, and let these guide the system’s visual, structural, and interactive elements.

<br>
## 2. Foreground depth

Ecosystems are not flat indicators that merely deliver data. The design must propose collaborative sense-making features that put complex processes, trade-offs, relations, and tensions in full focus.

Foregrounding depth means deliberately connecting biodiversity data to <span style="color:#00ADEE;">complex</span> ecological and societal challenges to enable further discourse and decision-making. Data systems thereby move from static data repositories to tools that stimulate reflection and action.

<br>
## 3. Align economic value with ecological dynamics

Developing a business case for the implementation of data tools can be important to generate impact across corporate stakeholders. But ecosystems themselves operate on more diverse, adaptive, and long-term dynamics that no business model can fully contain. 

<span style="color:#00ADEE;">The strongest business cases</span> will be those that work within, rather than attempt to override, resilient ecological understandings of value and growth. While existing tools push for further commodification of biodiversity, more ecologically aligned proposals should make value propositions that are already inherent in ecosystems. 

<br>
<br>

# DESIGN CONSTRAINTS


## Ecologies

Ecosystem knowledge is always partial, shaped by incomplete data, human perspectives, and evolving scientific understandings. Designs must stay open to <span style="color:#FAAE17;">diverse ways of knowing</span>, yet grounded in ecological integrity. Speculation, intuition, and creative approaches are integral, but should not justify ecological misrepresentation.

<br>

## Technologies

The design may be conceptual or a prototype, built with existing technologies or imagining new ones. Too often, environmental tools are driven by new technology trends, rather than ecological or socio-political needs. This brief instead requires that technological features emerge from the design’s <span style="color:#FAAE17;">ecological intentions</span>  and not the other way around.

<br>

## Socio-politics

All designs have socio-political effects. The design must therefore critically consider who and what it serves, and what it thereby risks ignoring. It must provide transparency about how decisions and data shape <span style="color:#FAAE17;">power</span> across humans and ecosystems. This includes asking how the design contributes to creating regenerative multispecies futures.
